This webshop was my final project during the Technigo bootcamp (spring 2021).</br>

The inspiration for this project is https://ohlamoon.se/, one of my favorite webshops. I wanted to create something similar since it's so pretty and I'm very much into design.üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</br>

The biggest challenges that I faced was how to prioritize (I will continue adding features, I feel like I've only just begun!) and how to keep track of everything I was doing. This project was so much bigger than all my previous ones and it was hard to plan and create a good structure. I also needed a lot of help creating the backend and the connection between backend and frontend.</br>

Technologies: React, React router, Redux, Mongoose Express, Styled components, Crypto, Bcrypt.</br>
